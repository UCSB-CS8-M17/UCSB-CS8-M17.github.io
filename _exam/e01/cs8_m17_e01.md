<ol>

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:1em;" > When working on the CSIL systems, there is something called your "home directory".

<ol>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:4em;">(3 pts) There is a Unix/Linux shell command, that if you type it, always changes your current working directory to your home directory.  Write that command in the space below.
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:4em;">(3 pts) There is a special symbol that stands for the home directory of the user that is logged in (i.e. your home directory when you are logged in, my home directory if I am logged in).  Please draw that symbol in the space below.
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:4em;">(3 pts) There is a special directory called the "root" directory.  What is the symbol used for the "root" directory? 
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:4em;">(3 pts) A relative path is always interpreted in the context of the "current working directory".  What is the Unix command that shows you your current working directory?
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:4em;">(3 pts) How can you tell if a path to a file or directory is a <em>relative path</em> or an <em>absolute path?</em>
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:4em;">(3 pts) To start work on a Python program you need to type a command that brings up the Integrated Development Environment for Python (version 3).  What is this command? 
</li>


</ol>

</li>

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:20em;" markdown="1"> (5 pts) A complete Python program that prints out the following message
is a very short program indeed:


<pre style="width:auto; border: none;">
I'm a coder!
</pre>

Please write that entire program in the space below.  You certainly have
more space than you will need.

</li>



<li style="margin-bottom:25em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts)  As you may recall from your math courses, 2&pi; radians = 360&deg;, therefore
to convert degrees to radians, we can divide by 360 and multiply by 2&pi;.

The value &pi; in Python is writen as `math.pi`, which of course, requires an appropriate
`import` statement.

Given this information, write the definition of a Python function called `deg2rad` that takes
a parameter called `degrees` and returns the corresponding value in radians.

</li> 

<li markdown="1"> (5 pts) Now write a function call to this function,
as you might type it at the Python prompt, for example, that computes
the number of radians equal to 45&deg;

</li>


<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:30em;">

(20 pts) In this course, we are using `pyunit` to test the Python functions
as we write them.    In the course of doing this testing, we make use of a
technique called writing "stub functions".

Suppose you are at a job interview for an internship that involves
coding.  The interviewer says: "Testing is very important here at
(name of company).  Have you ever done anything with testing before,
e.g. writing test cases, and using stubs?"

You say "why, sure!  I learned about stubs in my very first
programming class at UCSB!"

The interviewer says: "Great!  Then, you can tell me: what is a stub,
and what good is it?  I mean, why do you write a stub first, instead
of just going straight to writing the real function?"

What do you say?

Include <em>enough detail</em> in your answer so that the interview
knows that you are technically sharp, and they should hire you.  Do
not include so much extra detail that the interviewer finds you
tedious and annoying, and decides you would be painful to work with,
and chooses to not hire you.

Remember that it is a TWO PART QUESTION, and be sure you answer both
parts, i.e. <b>what</b> is a stub, and <b>why</b> write a stub?

Some points will be awarded for correctness, while others will be
awarded based on a good, fluid answer that will convince someone to
hire you.

</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;" > (10 pts) Now, to really show
that you understand the idea of a stub, actually write a stub for the
`deg2rad` function that you wrote earlier on this exam.


</li>

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;">
(15 pts) Testing a Python function can be done with the `pytest`
module, as we did in lab02 and lab03 in this course.


<style>
div.pre-box {
		width: 25em;
		margin-left: 2em;
		padding: 2em;
		border: none;
}
div.pre-box pre {
   width: 20em;
   border: none;
   background-color: white;
}

</style>

<div class="pre-box">

```
import pytest

def test_fToC_freezing():
   assert fToC(32.0)==pytest.approx(0.0) 

def test_cToF_freezing():
   assert cToF(0.0)==pytest.approx(32.0) 

def test_fToC_boiling():
   assert fToC(212.0)==pytest.approx(100.0) 

def test_cToF_boiling():
   assert cToF(100.0)==pytest.approx(212.0)
```
</div>

The code below are some example `pytest` tests taken directly from our
work on lab02.

<ol>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 8em;"> (8 pts) Why do we need the `pytest.approx` thing?

That is, why can't we just write: `assert cToF(100.0)==212.0`?

</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 30em;"> (9 pts) Now consider the `deg2rad` function you write earlier.   Please write
three test cases for that function.

<style>
div.test-case-table {
   float:right; width:15em;
}
div.test-case-table table * {
 text-align:center;
}
</style>

<div class="test-case-table" markdown="1">

| degrees | radians |
|---------|---------|
|   0     |   0     |
|  &pi;/2 |   90    |
|   &pi;  |  180    |

</div>

As values, you can use the values shown
below (recalling that you cannot write &pi; in Python, only `math.pi` in the
context of an appropriate `import` statement.)
