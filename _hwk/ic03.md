This is an in-class exercise.  There is no make-up (instead, if you miss it, it may be one of your four dropped grades.)

<li markdown="1"> One of the Python functions you were asked to write for one of the labs is the function `hasNoX` which was 
supposed to return `True` if the input were a string that does not contain `x` or `X`, and `False` in every other case (e.g.
if the input was not of type `str`.

For each of the following, there is an attempt at writing `hasNoX`, many of which contain bugs.  Your job is to do what Python
would do, i.e. indicate the output of the function call shown. 
Assume that it has been loaded into `idle3` and that we've selected `Run Module` (or pressed F5.)    
Then we typed in the function call shown, and something is printed as a result.  

Which of the answers shown matches what is printed? 

<table class="outputTable withLines">
<tr><td markdown="1">

| Function Call |  `True`  | `False` | `None` | error | something<br>else |

| `hasNoX_1("Xie") |   |   |   |   |   |
