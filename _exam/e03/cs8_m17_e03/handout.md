# Getting Started

* Open your web browser and navigate to <https://submit.cs.ucsb.edu>, and login.
* You may also open a web browser tab to <https://docs.python.org>

* Apart from these two sites, NO OTHER WEB ACCESS IS PERMITTED.

* In submit.cs, join the class for your section time, one of the following:
    * `CS8_m17_final_11a`
    * `CS8_m17_final_1230p`
    * `CS8_m17_final_2p`
    * `CS8_m17_final_330p`

* Locate the four programming assignments `EXAM_lf01`, `EXAM_lf02`, `EXAM_lf03` and
  `EXAM_lf04`.  These are the four questions that you'll be submitting code
  for during this exam.

# General Restrictions


* NO CELL PHONE USE, OR TALKING IS PERMITTED.
* KEEP YOUR EYES ON YOUR OWN SCREEN.  
* Once the exam is over, do not do any of the following until after 6pm
   * Discuss it with other students, even those that already took it
   * Access your CSIL account
   * Access your submit.cs account

# General instructions

* For each of these questions, you are submitting a Python file called,
   respectively, `lf01.py`, `lf02.py`, `lf03.py`, and `lf04.py`.
* Each of those files should contain (at least) a definition of a Python
   function with a specified name.
*  For each of the problems, when you submit your code to submit.cs, the system
   will ONLY show you the results of 10 points from the 25 total points for the
   problem:
   
   * 5 points for a correct Python 3 file with no syntax errors
   * 5 points for the fact that your file contains a function with the correct name.

   The other 15 points will be calculated later, and you will not be shown the results until all students have completed the lab exam.

* To emphasize this point: <b>If you at least submit the appropriate file containing a stub definition
    for that
    function, you will earn 10 of the 25 points for that problem.</b>  So,
    please at least do that!

    Then go back and try to make sure that each of your four functions
    works properly by doing as much of your own testing as you can.
