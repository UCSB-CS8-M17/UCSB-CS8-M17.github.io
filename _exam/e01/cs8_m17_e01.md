(20 pts) In this course, we are using `pyunit` to test the Python functions
as we write them.    In the course of doing this testing, we make use of a
technique called writing "stub functions".

Suppose you are at a job interview for an internship that involves
coding.  The interviewer says: "Testing is very important here at
(name of company).  Have you ever done anything with testing before,
e.g. writing test cases, and using stubs?"

You say "why, sure!  I learned about stubs in my very first
programming class at UCSB!"

The interviewer says: "Great!  Then, you can tell me: what is a stub,
and what good is it?  I mean, why do you write a stub first, instead
of just going straight to writing the real function?"

What do you say?

Include <em>enough detail</em> in your answer so that the interview
knows that you are technically sharp, and they should hire you.  Do
not include so much extra detail that the interviewer finds you
tedious and annoying, and decides you would be painful to work with,
and chooses to not hire you.

Remember that it is a TWO PART QUESTION, and be sure you answer both
parts, i.e. <b>what</b> is a stub, and <b>why</b> write a stub?

Some points will be awarded for correctness, while others will be
awarded based on a good, fluid answer that will convince someone to
hire you.
