For this lab, you will create two files:

* `lab06.py`, a file containing some function definitions
* `lab06_tests.py`, a file containing some test cases

There is starter code for each of these at the following link:

* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs8-m17/lab06_starter_code>

I suggest you proceed as follows:

1.  Create a directory called ~/cs8/lab06 (using the `mkdir` command) and `cd` into that directory.
2.  Use `idle3` (you might try `idle3 &` if you want to keep your prompt handy) to bring up idle3.
3.  Use "New File" to create empty files called `lab06.py` and `lab06.py` in that `~/cs8/lab06` directory.
4.  ONE AT A TIME, copy the function definitions from the starter code, and the tests that go along with those.
   * By one a a time, what I mean is
