* Right now, while you are thinking about it:
   * Write your name, umail, and seat number on p. 1, 3 and 5. DO IT NOW.
   * Write your name on your notes sheet, and your yellow sheet.

* (1a)  "What is the specific problem that <s>arises</s> <b>would arise if `pytest.appprox` were not used</b>"
* (3) Answer ONLY with what you would TYPE.   Do NOT include any shell prompt.  If you would not TYPE it, don't write it.
* (4b) You don't need to put any `import` statements.  Just the two test cases is fine.
