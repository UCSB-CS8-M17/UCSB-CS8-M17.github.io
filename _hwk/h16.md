<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

Please read {{page.desc}}.  Then complete these problems.


<ol>

{% include hwk_li_name_10pts.html %}

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:0em"> (20 pts) Write an python function definition `count_ae` that takes one parameter `s` and returns 0 if `s` is not a string, otherwise returns the number of occurences of `a` and `e` in that string (only lowercase).  For example * `count_ae(-42)` should return `0`
* `count_ae("Santa Ynez")` should return `3`
* `count_ae("Santa Ana")`  should return `3` (the uppercase `A` does not count)

</li>


<li markdown="1"> For each of the problems below, write a python functions with the name indicated that takes one parameter called `aList`, or test cases for those functions (in the style of `pytest`).  In each case, you may assume `aList` is of type `list` and that all values in `aList` are of type `int`, and that `aList` contains at least two elements.  For these problems, you don't need to check those things.

Your code may not modify the list in any way.  If you want to make a sorted copy of the list as a local variable, you may use this code:

```
   sortedCopy = aList[:].sort()  # creates a local copy of the list, sorted.
```

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;">	(10 pts) `minValue`, which returns the minimum value in the list *without* using the built-in function `min`.
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;">	(10 pts) `avgValue` which returns the average value of the elements in the list.   You may any built in functions available in Python, or compute the sum using the accumulator pattern (your choice).
</li>

<!-- <li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:4em;">	(10 pts) The median of the list assigned to a variable of your choice. The median of a sequence of numbers is the value of the number in the middle of the list when the numbers are arranged in sorted order. For example given lst = [2, 80, 20, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the median is 1.    When there is an even number of items in the list, the median is the average of the two elements closest to the middle.  For example, the median of `[5, 6, 1, 50]` is `5.5` (i.e. `(5+6)/2)`.    
-->

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;"> (10 pts) `secondSmallest` which computes the second smallest element in the list (not the second smallest value).   For example, `secondSmallest([3,7,3])` should return `3`.
